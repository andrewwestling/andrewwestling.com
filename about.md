I'm a software engineer in New York City. I work at [Better.com](https://better.com).

I previously worked on the teams at [Architizer](https://architizer.com) and [EyeCue Lab](http://eyecuelab.com).

I play the violin with [Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra](https://brooklynsymphonyorchestra.org) in my free time.

I grew up in Oregon. I have a degree in architecture from University of Oregon.
