I'm Andrew M Westling.

I'm a software engineer in New York City. I work at [Better](https://better.com). 

I previously worked on the teams at [Architizer](https://architizer.com) and [EyeCue Lab](http://eyecuelab.com).

I grew up in Oregon. I have a degree in architecture and I'm an amateur violinist in my free time.
