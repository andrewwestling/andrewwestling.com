### üëî Work

For work, I build software. I got laid off in June 2022, so I'm currently open to new work opportunities.

I previously worked on the teams at:

- [Monograph](https://monograph.com), a practice-management tool for architects
- [Better](https://better.com), an online mortgage lender
- [Architizer](https://architizer.com), a tool to help architects find building products
- [EyeCue Lab](https://eyecuelab.com), a product development consultancy

You can read more about my background on my [resume](/resume).

### üéª Music

As a hobby, I play the violin in community orchestras around New York City in my free time.

Lately, I've performed with:

- [Greenwich Village Orchestra](https://gvo.org)
- [Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra](https://brooklynsymphonyorchestra.org)
- [Centre Symphony Orchestra](https://centresymphony.com)
- [Litha Symphony](https://lithasymphony.org)

I commemorate my musical progress and experiences on a playful "violinstagram" account called [@antiperformances](https://instagram.com/antiperformances).

### üöó Cars

I love driving and learning about quirky cars.

I own a 2013 Volvo C30 T5 6-speed. I sometimes post about my ownership experience on [this page]().

### üìê Education

I grew up in Oregon. I have a degree in architecture from University of Oregon.

I haven't published much from my architecture days, but you can read about my [Media Cube project](/media-cube).
