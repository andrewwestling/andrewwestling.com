<Message>
  <Text as="p">
    I'm a designer-turned-engineer. I was going to be an architect, but then I
    got distracted by the web.
  </Text>
  <Text as="p" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
    These days, I build web apps. My favorite things to work on are design
    systems, and front end features for TypeScript and JavaScript applications.
    I'm handy with the usual infrastructure and build tools. I also like to
    think about how processes scale, and how teams can work together more
    harmoniously.
