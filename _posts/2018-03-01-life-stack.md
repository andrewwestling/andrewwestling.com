title: Life Stack

---

This is my "life stack," a collection of products and services I use in my daily life. 

This exists partially just so I can keep track of what I own, but it also may serve the interests of others who are curious about what I use and can recommend in my day-to-day life.

## Computers
### **Apple MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017)** laptop computer
Primary home Mac. It is configure-to-order with 1.4GHz i7 and 16GB RAM. No hiccups yet. Amazing speaker for such a small machine.

### **Apple MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)** laptop computer
My company Mac. Excellent generation of the MacBook Pro in terms of power and productivity. It's going to be a bummer when I can't use this thing anymore and am forced to buy some nonsense with a touch bar to get similar performance.

### **Apple iPhone 8 (Space Gray, 64GB)** mobile phone
Primary mobile device. I tried to switch to Android and bought a Pixel 2, but I couldn't give up iMessage, so I returned it and bought an iPhone 8. Confined within the walled garden for another cycle, I guess.

### **Apple iPad mini 4 (Gold, 64GB)** tablet
Primary bedtime screen. I watch too much YouTube and play too much Chess.com Tactics on this device. I used to be of the mind that no one with a laptop and a smartphone needed an iPad. Then I impulse-bought this device refurbished when they stopped making a 64GB model, and it was cheaper than the 32GB model at the time. Go figure. Also, it's gold. Not my first choice, but hey, it's Trump's America now.

### **Apple Time Capsule (2TB)** wireless router
Primary workhorse router. This thing has served me well since I bought it in 2013 as my first employee purchase while working for Apple. Nice to look at, backs up my shit automatically, and it _just works™_. Not sure what else I need in a router.



## Online Services
### **G Suite** 
My primary email/calendar/contacts host for andrewwestling.com. I'm grandfathered into the "free" version from when Google was piloting their offerings, but I'd still pay for it if I wasn't. I use my personal domain for email so that it will be portable in the future, and Google makes this one fewer thing to waste my cycles on.

### **Google Keep**
The closest product I've seen realized for my notepad wet dream. Voice transcription, device syncing, easy input, tags, search - everything I want, but don't want to build, myself. I just wish it supported Markdown and had an API that wasn't Google Takeout.

### **Google Voice**
I've been a Google Voice user since Sprint announced native integration with their service. I no longer use the native integration but I still believe in what Google Voice could have been ... Now I use it for a second phone number in the (646) area code to mask my real mobile number.

### **Google Maps Timeline**
Google Maps Timeline is basically a passive proxy diary of my life. For the small price of My Privacy™, I get digests of all the places I went each month, and I can recount all the weird transit transfers and late-night stopovers I make in my day-to-day. New York City has so many neat places to discover and this is a nice way to remember what I do each day without having to write it all down.

### **Krypton**
My SSH key lives on my phone, and I don't have to think about it ever again. Great.

### **1Password**
Password managers have become a way of life. Use one, seriously. I took the time in 2017 to update all my passwords to 24-character random strings, and now I don't have to think about passwords again. 1Password is almost always the first thing I install whenever I set up a new device (out of necessity, really). I pay for the subscription to my.1password.com because, again, one fewer thing to waste cycles managing myself.

### **Spotify Premium**
A must for anyone who spends all day programming in an open office.

### **Chess.com Premium**
Unlimited Tactics puzzles. That's the primary reason I pay for premium. I have a slight web crush on Chess.com just because it's exactly what it says on the box - Chess, and only Chess.

### **Netflix**
Not sure why I still have Netflix but it just keeps sipping on my credit card every month, and I just keep opening it whenever I need a Family Guy fix or to watch some new comedy special by some comedian I thought I liked until their sexual harassment accusers came forward.

### **HBO Now**
Primarily so I can watch Last Week Tonight and Silicon Valley. I wish I cared about Game of Thrones so this subscription would be slightly more worth it. But I'm adulting now and I can afford to pay for media.

### **MoviePass**
Basically too good to be true and everyone knows it. I guess I'll just ride this one out, and let venture capitalists pay for my movie tickets for as long as possible.

### **Gandi.net** domain registrar
I can't even remember why Gandi is my domain registrar. It works well enough. I probably Googled "best domain registrar 2013" and these guys had the best SEO and reviews at the time. Domain registrars are weird.

## Other Items
### **Lamy Safari** fountain pen
My excellent fountain pen. I have two of these - one for "desk" settings that uses an inkwell, and one for "field" settings that uses cartridges. I haven't bought a pen in years because I just buy ink now. Don't buy cheap pens. I have one of these because I went to a Francis D. K. Ching lecture when I was in architecture school, and someone asked him what his favorite pen was and it was unequivocally this. Also an excellent conversation starter. So many people comment on this pen.

### **Moleskine Cahier Journal** (extra large, plain, black, soft cover, 7.5" x 10") notebook
I buy these in bulk. I hate the idea that I won't be able to find another notebook I like when I finish one, so I just keep a few handy. These are good, but don't get them wet (or don't keep them in a backpack while it's raining). 

### **Bose SoundTrue II Around-Ear** headphones
A gift from my company when we moved into an open office. These are the first higher-quality headphones I've had. Can't complain, they do the job.

### **Minaal Carry On 2.0** travel backpack
Excellent single-bag travel backpack. I bought this originally for a two-week trip to Europe. Chase Reeves' YouTube review sold me on it. I made a video of myself packing my bag and I got on Minaal's Instagram. Yeah. Just a good bag.

### **Fjällräven Räven 20L** daily carry backpack

### **Tivoli Audio Model One** tabletop radio

### **Sony ICFC1** alarm clock radio

### **Nike Roshe Daybreak** sneakers
My favorite pine green and yellow pair of sneakers. These sneakers have basically become a part of who I am, as a person, at my core. I need to find replacements because I'm going to wear these out and be really sad soon. Why does Nike only run styles for a season at a time?

### **Nike Roshe One** sneakers
I own these primarily because I saw so many people here complimenting their black jeans with all-black modern Nike sneakers. There's something about Roshe One that makes them future classics. To be completely honest, they're a little wide for my feet but I still like them.

### **Cole Haan Cranston Chukka** boots
Just some shoes I impulse-bought when winter came because my other desert boots have soles that have no grip in the weather. These are basically the BMW X3 of boots, because that's _technically_ an SUV, and these boots are _technically_ waterproof, but neither is the most stylish, nor the most capable for its purpose. And I probably paid too much for them. Just like X3 owners. Whatever. They work.

### **O clock classic** watch

### **Levi's 511 Slim Fit** jeans
These should be in the Brooklyn starter pack - everyone who moves here should be issued a pair of black jeans upon arrival. I literally wear a pair of these every day (don't worry, I rotate, I rotate) but at this point, I'm not sure I even know how to wear pants that aren't Levi's 511 black jeans. Most versatile piece of clothing I can think of. I can wear black jeans to the office, then to an event or on a date in the evening, and no one looks at me funny in any setting.

### **Klean Kanteen Insulated Wide** (16oz, loop cap, shale black) water bottle

### **Manhasset M48** music stand
This is hands-down the best music stand you can ask for. If you aren't concerned about portability, this thing is rock solid and you shouldn't buy anything else.

### **Oral-B Pro 1000** electric toothbrush
Dentist told me to buy an electric toothbrush so I'd stop scrubbing my gums away. Honestly this toothbrush is just fine. It's nothing special. The Wirecutter told me I didn't need the expensive Sonicare models, so I just bought this one.

### **D'Addario Zyex** (Aluminum D, Medium Tension) violin strings

### **Swedish Dream Seaweed Soap** soap
Just some good soap. I first received a bar of this stuff as a gift from a girlfriend and I'm sold forever now.

### **Black+Decker BDH2000PL** handheld vacuum cleaner
